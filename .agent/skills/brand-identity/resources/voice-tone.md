# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text, adhere to this brand persona inspired by premium design-forward brands (Apple, Riot, High-end Studios).

## Brand Personality Keywords

* **Visionary:** We speak to the future.
* **Effortless:** We make complex things sound simple and magical.
* **Premium:** We use confident, concise language. No begging, no clutter.
* **Immersive:** We invite the user into an experience.

## Grammar & Mechanics rules

* **Headings:** Use Title Case for punchy, short headlines (e.g., "Your World. Expanded.").
* **Punctuation:** confident. Use full stops. Avoid exclamation points (!) unless celebrating a major user victory. Minimalist punctuation is better.
* **Clarity:** Active voice. Short words. "It just works."
* **Formatting:** Break text into small, digestible chunks.
